# Jigsaw Client source code

1.8.8 Source Code is Jigsaw v0.26
1.12.2 Source Code is Jigsaw v1.01

Jigsaw was a Minecraft hacked client, revolutionary at its time. It could switch between a ghost client and a normal client, and was the first client with infinite reach. I started beveloping the client when I was 14 years old, and it quickly grew to be one of the most popular ones! There are no longer any official download links availabe, but I recently made the source code public.
